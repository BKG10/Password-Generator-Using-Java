_**Introduction**_

The Password Generator Project is a Java Console Application designed to create random, secure passwords and assess their strength. This project aims to provide a simple and effective way for users to generate strong passwords tailored to their specific needs and to evaluate the strength of existing passwords.
The application offers both password generation and strength-checking functionalities. Initially developed as a console-based tool, future improvements include creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance usability.

_**Functionalities**_

Generating a Password:

Users specify preferences for including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Users input the desired password length.
A password alphabet is generated based on these preferences.
Random characters from the password alphabet are combined to create the password.
The generated password is displayed on the console.
Checking a Password's Strength:

The strength check evaluates the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and password length.
Passwords are scored based on these criteria, with scores determining the strength rating (weak/medium/good/great).
Displaying Useful Information:

The application provides tips on password security, such as avoiding repeated characters, keyboard patterns, dictionary words, and sequences.
This project aims to help users enhance their password security by generating strong passwords and educating them on best practices for password creation and management.
